The snow glows white on the mountain tonight<br>Not a footprint to be seen<br>A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the Queen<br>The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside<br>Couldn't keep it in; heaven knows I tried<br><br>Don't let them in<br>Don't let them see<br>Be the good girl you always have to be<br>Conceal<br>Don't feel<br>Don't let them know<br>Well, now they know<br><br>Let it go, let it go<br>Can't hold it back anymore<br>Let it go, let it go<br>Turn away and slam the door<br>I don't care what they're going to say<br>Let the storm rage on<br>The cold never bothered me anyway<br><br>It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small<br>And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all<br>It's time to see what I can do<br>To test the limits and break through<br>No right, no wrong<br>No rules for me...I'm free<br><br>Let it go, let it go<br>I am one with the wind and sky<br>Let it go, let it go<br>You'll never see me cry<br>Here I stand and here I'll stay<br>Let the storm rage on<br><br>My power flurries through the air into the ground<br>My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around<br>And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast<br>I'm never going back<br>The past is in the past<br><br>Let it go, let it go<br>And I'll rise like the break of dawn<br>Let it go, let it go<br>That perfect girl is gone<br>Here I stand in the light of day<br>Let the storm rage on<br>The cold never bothered me anyway
